# stellarized-xresources

This is a script to generte `Xresources` files for the [stellarized
colorscheme](https://github.com/nightsense/stellarized).

To acquire the files, navigate to this directory and run `./generate`. Two
files will be generated, corresponding to the dark and light themes.

I claim no guarantee of functionality for this script; in the event that the
original `.vim` theme files are changed to no longer follow the same format,
this script will fail.
